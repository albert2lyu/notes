* Install gclient
  * checkout gclient source
    svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
  * Add depot_tools to your PATH:
    - $ export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:"$PATH"
    - You may want to add this to your .base_aliases file or your shell's equivalent so that you don’t need to reset your $PATH manually each time you open a new shell.


* Getting the code and building
Create a working directory, then call:

gclient config https://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
gclient sync --force

On Windows, if you use cygwin, call gclient.bat instead of gclient:

gclient.bat config https://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
gclient.bat sync --force

The sync will generate build files for your native build environment (Linux:make, OSX: XCode, Windows: Visual Studio). This generation can also be forced manually:

gclient runhooks --force

You should now be able to build the sample programs peerconnection_client (Windows only) and peerconnection_server (Windows, Linux).
